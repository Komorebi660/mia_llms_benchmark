# Benchmarking MIAs against LLMs. 

This repository contains the code (and instructions to access the datasets) 
for the paper ["SoK: Membership Inference Attacks on LLMs are Rushing
Nowhere (and How to Fix It)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17975). 

We provide an easy-to-use framework to evaluate MIAs against LLMs, 
benchmarking their performance compared to MIAs from the literature 
across **the (proper) benchmarks recommended in the paper**. 

## (1) Installation

In your python environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the required dependencies. 

To run this code, access to GPUs is recommended.
